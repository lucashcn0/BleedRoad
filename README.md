# BleedRoad
This is my first game project, it was a school project with 6 members in Etec jornalista roberto marinho in São Paulo Brazil in june 2025, i wrote the the code.
The game involves a group of friends who, after a party, accidentally run someone over while returning home. We have to try and resolve the situation in the best way possible.
We created this game in Ren'py, using Python. The narrative logic was relatively simple, but it was a bit of a challenge for me, since it was my first time programming in Ren'py. However, over time I got the hang of the labels.
With this project, I learned a bit about logic programming and how visual novels work.
Unfortunately the game is not complete because some of my friends can't finish the backgrounds, but i decide to post here to mark my progress as a developer, i hope you like it.

You can play the demo on itch.io:
